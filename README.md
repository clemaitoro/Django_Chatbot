# Django_Chatbot
Basic django chatbot that can do these following things 
* **Greetings:** Say "hello" and it wil greet you back.
  * **Goodbyes:** Say "goodbye" and it wil respond in a (slightly dramatic) way. 
  * **Random Images:** Say "gimme image" and it wil show you a random image from the internet.
  * **Wikipedia Lookups:** Ask me "tell me about [topic]" and it wil provide a link to the Wikipedia article for that topic. (Example: "tell me about cats")
  * **Weather:** Ask me "weather in [location]" and it wil try to fetch the current temperature in Celsius for that location using an API. (Example: "weather in London")
